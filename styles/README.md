# CSS files

Here are stored the compiled css files that you will be importing in your routes.
They are generated when running `npm run dev` using `npm-run-all`.

This approach is inspired by the Sass Example on github: https://github.com/remix-run/examples/tree/main/sass

When importing the files from this folder in your routes, you can use the following structure so you don't have to navigate back through the folders:
`import stylesheetUrl from "styles/stylesheet.css";`
